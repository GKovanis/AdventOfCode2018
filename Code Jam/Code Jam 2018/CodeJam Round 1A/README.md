Problems "Cryptopangrams.py" and "DatBae.py" did not pass the test sets, keeping them for future reference of thought process.

**How to run the interactive test program**

1. Add this line as the first line in the script:

 #!/usr/bin/env python3

2. Make the script an executable, e.g. :

chmod +x DatBae.py

3. Run the following command:

python interactive_runner.py python testing_tool.py 0 -- ./DatBae.py
